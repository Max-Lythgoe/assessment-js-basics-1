// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "Gathering all specific details required for a new system (system requirements, resources, etc.) and figuring out ideas for prototypes."
const Design = "Outline details for the project creating user and system interfaces and requirements."
const Implementation = "This is where the project is coded by the development team, this is based off of the design and analysis from earlier steps."
const TestingAndIntegration = "After the software has been coded, QA teams and developers will test every aspect of the application to look for bugs or problems to ensure they are fixed in the final product before release."
const Maintain = "Now that the software is published and used by consumers, the development team will regularly assess it and make sure things are running smoothly and without problem and fix any issues that arise or add enhancements if requested."
